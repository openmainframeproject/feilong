      "message": "ReqHandle initializes the results structure to 0 for the overallRC, rc and rs.  Thus, at this time, it is 0.  This routine implements a subfunction and is not a general subroutine so it can assume that it is called with a fresh ReqHandle.  \n\nIf we put in support for reused ReqHandles then we will have a full reset function that would reset all of the values.  The SDK would be expected to use that function if it were reusing an existing ReqHandle.",
