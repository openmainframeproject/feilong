On RHEL7 or later system, when SElinux works in "Enforcing" mode, IUCV communication between
daemon and client is not allowed. For SLES and Ubuntu system, as SELINUX is not installed by
default, this is not an issue.

This file describes:
1. How to generate the SELinux policy files to allow IUCV communication.
2. How to install the proper SELinux policy in the correct directory on the IUCV target guest.
3. Why there is a difference between the SELinux policy file for newly deployed OpenStack/xCAT
   guests and the policy file for existing guests.


1. How to generate the SELinux policy files to allow IUCV communication on a RHEL7 or later
system with SELinux running in "Enforcing" mode.
   a. Install policycoreutils-devel.

   b. Generate the iucvselx(_running).te file, which is the source of the .pp file.
      i. For a system newly deployed via OpenStack/xCAT:
             "grep iucvserv /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -m iucvselx > iucvselx.te"
      ii. For an existing system, deployed via another method:
             "grep iucvserv /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -m iucvselx_running >
              iucvselx_running.te"

   c. Generate the iucvselx(_running).pp file, which is the SElinux policy file for the IUCV daemon.
      i. For a system newly deployed via OpenStack/xCAT:
             "grep iucvserv /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M iucvselx.pp"
      ii. For an existing system, deployed via another method:
             "grep iucvserv /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M iucvselx_running.pp"

2. How to install the proper SELinux policy in the correct directory on the IUCV target guest.
   On the target system:
      "semodule -i iucvselx.pp" or "semodule -i iucvselx_running.pp"

3. The difference between the SELinux policy file for newly deployed OpenStack/xCAT guests vs the
   policy file for existing guests.
   a. When the system is deployed by OpenStack, IUCV related files are copied by zvmguestconfigure
      at the system init stage, and the IUCV daemon process runs in the init_t domain.

   b. For an existing running system, we use "scp" to copy file to the target guest,  and the IUCV
      daemon process runs in the unconfined_service_t domain.

   Thus two policy files are needed to handle different scenarios.
