      "message": "You will need to keep this code to attempt to get the vlan info null terminated string. The data, if there is obtained in two parts. 1) get a null term string() 2) break up that string by blank delimiter. I would think if the code just tries to get blank delimited tokens, it may have a problem with the last token since it is null terminated? What do you think? Did you try it out?\nchar vlan_info[vlanCount * 9];\n                token \u003d strtok_r(NULL, \"\\0\", \u0026buffer);\n                if (token !\u003d NULL) {\n                    strcpy(vlan_info, token);\n                }",
