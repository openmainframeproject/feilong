How to add functional testcases and run tests
---------------------------------------------

Install FVT requirements
========================

1. Install the dependencies listed in the python-zvm-sdk/fvt-requirements.txt.
     .. code-block:: text

        cd python-zvm-sdk
        pip install -r fvt-requirements.txt

2. Install the following packages with the package manager of your target platform:

   * genisoimage


Configure functional test environment
=====================================

First of all, you should have a zCC installed, configured and works correctlly.
It is requred to put at least one deployable image into your test environment.

Test options should be set in '[tests]' section in zvmsdk.conf. Required test
options:

- restapi_url: REST API URL. Sample value: 'http://127.0.0.1:8888'

- images: Test image file path plus operating system version, separated by ':'.
  Several images can be specified to test, separated by ','. Sample value:
  '/var/lib/zvmsdk/images/netboot/rhel8.9/test_image1:rhel8.9, /var/lib/zvmsdk/images/netboot/sles15/test_image2:sles15'

- vswitch: The vswitch that test guests connect to.

- ip_addr_list: A list of test ip addresses. Sample value:
  '192.168.0.2 192.168.0.3 192.168.0.4 192.168.0.5 192.168.0.6'
  You may need to add a new nic to your zCC node and make sure your zCC is able
  to connect to the guest that deployed with these ip addresses.

- gateway_v4: gateway that used to configure guest network interface.

- cidr: CIDR of guest network for tests.


Optional test options that better to set:

- userid_prefix: Prefix for test guest userid. Set this to make sure your test
  guests have different prefix with other test environment.


Creating new testcases
======================

Add new functional testcases when:

- For every new feature, functional testcases should be created.

- If submitting a bug fix that had no functional testcases to cover the change,
  a new functional testcase should be created.

Test modules overview:

- base.py: base testcase class for all fvt testcase classes. Implement common
  init steps in this module.

- test_utils.py: Implemented a simple zCC client, which is used to send zCC
  REST request. And implementd test utils, which includes methods to implement
  complex helper functions, for example, deploy_guest invokes several zCC calls
  to deploy a guest in one test utils method.

- test_suites.py: Define test suites, e.g. bvt test suites.

- other test modules: Adding testcases to test modules accordingly. e.g.
  test_guest.py is for guest actions tests, test_image is for image related
  tests.

Please **NOTE**:

- All common utils methods should be added into test utils, instead of
  individual test modules.

- All zCC REST request should be sent through zCC client in test_utils.py.

- For those tests should be run in different Linux distros, please add tests
  into one of the following two test classes in test_guest.py:

  * GuestHandlerTestCase.

    (Add @parameterized.expand(TEST_IMAGE_LIST) to extend the case, you can refer to test_guest_live_resize_cpus).

  * GuestHandlerTestCaseWithMultipleDeployedGuest.

    (Add @parameterized.expand(TEST_USERID_LIST) to extend the case, you can refer to test_guest_power_actions).


Run function tests
==================

Run one testcase:
``python -m unittest -v zvmsdk.tests.fvt.test_guest.GuestHandlerTestCaseWithMultipleDeployedGuest.test_guest_get_console_output``

Run one test class:
``python -m unittest -v zvmsdk.tests.fvt.test_guest.GuestHandlerTestCaseWithMultipleDeployedGuest``

Run bvt:
``python -m unittest zvmsdk.tests.fvt.test_suites.bvt``

Run full round of fvt:
``python -m unittest discover -v -s zvmsdk.tests.fvt``
