  CiKaDa Stream Format:
        1 byte - Number of records in the next track
        Array  - Key counts.  2 dimension array which represents key
                 count information for each record in the track.
                 One row per unique key in a series of key counts.  If
                 the same key count is used multiple times consecutively
                 then only one row has the key count and the number of
                 times it was consecutively specified.
                 First element - (1 byte) Number of consecutive records
                 that have this key count.
                 Second element - (1 byte) key count (i.e. # of keys).
        Array  - Data counts.  2 dimension array of data information.
                 One row per unique data length in a series of data
                 lengths.  Each record has a data length but if
                 consecutive records have the same data length then we
                 only keep one row with the data length and count the
                 number of consecutive times this count is used.
                 First element - (1 byte) Number of consecutive records
                 that have this length data.
                 Second element - (2 bytes) Data length value.
        Array  - Key and data values for each record.  Unlike the
                 previous key and data count arrays we have one row
                 for each record.
                 First element - (x bytes) keys.  The number of keys
                 depends upon the related key count in the key count
                 array.
                 Second element - (x bytes) data.  The amount of data
                 depends upon the related data length in the data count
                 array.

  ECKD Cylinder Layout:
        16 byte header - Track header
                 2 bytes - Cylinder Index
                 2 bytes - Track Index
                12 bytes - Miscellaneous usage.
        For each record in the track, we have a record header as shown in
        the RecordMetadata structure followed by the keys and the
        data for the record.  The key length and data length is specified
        in the RecordMetadata structure.
