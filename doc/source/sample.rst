Basic Usage
***********

This section would introduce the basics of using IBM z/VM Cloud Connector to manage z/VM host, some samples
are given here.

Workflow description
====================

Spawning a virtual machine
--------------------------

.. image:: ./images/spawn_flow.jpg

1) Image import from external image repository into IBM z/VM Cloud Connector, for one image, only need to be done once
2) Store the information into DB record
3) Call from upper layer to create a guest, this will define a .user direct. through z/VM SMAPI and DIRMAINT based on user input along with the disks allocations 
4) SMAPI call DIRMAINT to define a user direct
5) Call from upper layer to deploy a guest
6) In turn, IBM z/VM Cloud Connector start to copy disk contents from image to the allocated disks in step 3
7) Post deploy actions such as network setup, customerized files from IBM z/VM Cloud Connector the new deploy VM
8) Start the VM 
9) During power on of the VM (first time) , doing setup of the network and utilize the customerized files to update network, hostname etc (by default, using cloud-init)

Creating a vswitch
------------------

.. image:: ./images/create_vswitch_flow.jpg

1) Call from upper layer to trigger the Vswitch create call
2) HTTP service (IBM z/VM Cloud Connector REST API) get the request and handle to IBM z/VM Cloud Connector server
3) In turn SMAPI was called and handle the VSWITCH cerate command, this will include persistent definition of Vswitch and define in z/VM CP
4) CP was called to create vswitch on the fly

Usage Sample
============

The sample would be added later about calling IBM z/VM Cloud Connector RESTful API for managing z/VM host.
