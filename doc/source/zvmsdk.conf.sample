# The recommend value of SHARE. From z/VM doc, SHARE is relative value of
# virtual machine and if you set SHARE to 100 while virtual CPUs are 4,
# then each vCPU get 25 entitlement.
# 
# So the mechanism currently is:
# 
# 1) If a share is given, set SHARE value to the VM
# 2) If no SHARE is given during creation, check user_default_share_unit
# 3) If user_default_share_unit is 0, do nothing
# 4) If user_default_share_unit it not 0(current default is 100),
# then insert statement `SHARE RELATIVE user_default_share_unit*vCPU`
# into user direct, for example, with user_default_share_unit=100,
# 4 vCPU will create `SHARE RELATIVE 400`.
# 
# This align the best practice of z/VM recommendation.

# This param is optional
#user_default_share_unit=100
