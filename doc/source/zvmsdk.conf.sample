[guest]

# 
# The maximum allowed console log size, in kilobytes.

[monitor]

# 
# Cached monitor data update interval
# 
# This is used to prevent excessive effort spent retrieving the
# monitor data by calling the SDK backend utilities. When this cache
# is enabled, a inspect call will only call the SDK backend utilities
# when the inspected guest's info does not exist in the cache or
# when the cache data is expired. And when an cache update is needed,
# all the existing guests' data will be retrieved in a single call to
# the backend.
# 
# When this value is below or equal to zero, the cache
# will be disabled and each inspect call will need to call the backend
# utilities to get the inspected guest's monitor data.
#         
# This param is optional
#cache_interval=300

# Client will be requested to input username/password in order
# to authorize the call.
# Set this to 'none' indicated no auth will be used and 'auth'
# means username and password need to be specified.
# 
# Possible value:

# 
# This param is optional
#auth=none


# 
# file path that contains admin-token to access sdk http server.
# 
# Admin-token in order to get a user-token from zvm sdk, and the user-token
# will be used to validate request before user-token expire.
# 
# This param is optional
#token_path=/etc/zvmsdk/token.dat


# 
# How long the token is valid.
# 
# If a token auth is used, the token return to user will be

[zvm]

# 
# Default LOGONBY userid(s) for the cloud.
# 
# This is a set of z/VM userid(s) which are allowed to logon using the LOGONBY
# keyword to the guests created by the z/VM SDK solution, compatible with
# the LBYONLY keyword of the user directory statement. This value is only used
# when a guest is created. If you change this value, existing guests' directory
# entries are not automatically updated with the new value.
# When an ESM is installed, this parameter only governs when the ESM
# defers to CP's processing.
# 
# Usage note:
#     The default is an empty string (''). When the string is empty, you can't
#     log on to your instances using the 3270 protocol; When a
#     non-empty string is provided, blank chars will be used as delimiter,
#     you can use LOGONBY xxx command to log on the
#     OpenStack created guest using the corresponding admin userid's password.
# 
#     For example, when you set this value to 'oper1 oper2 oper3 jones', it means
#     you can use any one of 'oper1', 'oper2', 'oper3', 'jones' as an admin user.
# 
#     see the z/VM CP Planning and Administration for additional information.
# 
# Possible values:
#     A maximum of 8 blank-delimited strings. Each non-blank string must be a
#     valid z/VM userid.
#     e.g  '' is a valid value.
#          'oper1 oper2' is a valid value.
#          'o1 o2 o3 o4 o5 o6 o7 o8 o9' is NOT a valid value.
#     
# This param is optional
#default_admin_userid=


# 
# Virtual device number for default NIC address.
# 
# This value is the first NIC virtual device number,
# each NIC needs 3 numbers for control/read/write, so by default
# the first NIC's address is 1000, the second one is 1003 etc.
# 
# Possible values:
#     An integer value in hex format, between 0 and 65536 (x'FFFF').
#     It should not conflict with other device numbers in the z/VM guest's
#     configuration, for example device numbers of the root or ephemeral or
#     persistent disks.
# 
# Sample NIC definitions in the z/VM user directory:
#     NICDEF 1000 TYPE QDIO LAN SYSTEM <vswitch1> MACID <macid1>
#     NICDEF 1003 TYPE QDIO LAN SYSTEM <vswitch2> MACID <macid2>
#         
# This param is optional
#default_nic_vdev=1000


#

# on your z/VM system, which will be used for ephemeral disks for
# new guest. A dollar sign ($) is not allowed in the name.
# 
# Second part is type of the disk in the disk pool.
# The disks in the disk pool must all be the same type (ECKD or FBA).
# Possible values of the disk pool type:
#     A string, either ECKD or FBA.
# 
# Sample configuration:
#     diskpo1:ECKD
#     testpool:FBA
#     
# This param is required

# This param is optional
#user_default_password=


# 
# PROFILE name to use when creating a z/VM guest.

# common statements from a PROFILE definition.
# This PROFILE must already be included in your z/VM user directory.
# 
# Possible values:
#     An 8 character name of a PROFILE that is already defined in the z/VM
#     user directory.
#     
# This param is required
#user_profile=


# 
# Virtual device number for root disk.
# 
# When SDK deploys an guest, it creates a root disk and potentially
# several data disks. This value is the virtual device number of the root
# disk.
# 
# Possible values:
#     An integer value in hex format, between 0 and 65536 (x'FFFF').
#     It should not conflict with other device numbers in the z/VM guest's
#     configuration, for example device numbers of the NICs or ephemeral or
#     persistent disks.
# 
# Sample root disk in user directory:
#     MDISK 0100 <disktype> <start> <end> <volumelabel> <readwrite>
# 
# This param is optional
#user_root_vdev=0100
