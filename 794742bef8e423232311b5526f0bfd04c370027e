      "message": "So I\u0027m curious here why we just use the results[\u0027response\u0027] in our error message and not a custom error message?  I think this does not get set in disableEnableDisk, but rather by execCmdThruIUCV.  So while that\u0027s going to give a nice message about what IUCV command was being issued on the guest and what output it got, it might be nice to wrapper that in \"tried to execute a command to detach disk from guest, failure message....\"",
