## Meeting Notes

### Introduction of new attendees
- Alex Kim joined us but due to microphone issues, we will introduce next time

### Update on CI/CD infrastructure effort
- Preliminary email updates from Ji Chen and Haijie Wu indicate that new coding is having issues since CI/CD is not yet ready
- CI/CD environment could share with Zowe but there are concerns about credentials/keys possibly used by others
  - John indicated there are talks between two IBM groups about this; hopeing they can work it out and build a trust of the users of the environment
  - Building a one-off CI/CD, although can be done, is not an efficient use of time and resources. The goal is to leverage Zowe if possible

## Next meeting agenda topics
- Discuss ideas how to increase number of Feilong participants
- Update on how-to access z/VM resource effort
- Update on CI/CD infrastructure effort
