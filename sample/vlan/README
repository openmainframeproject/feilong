This is a demo on how to deploy 4 VMs with VLAN ID.

createvm_vlan_v1s1.py will create a VM with name DEMOV1S1, and the other scripts
with createvm_vlan prefix will do similar thin, create VM with prefix DEMO with
suffix get from the script file.

so after all 4 VMs created, DEMOV1S1 and DEMOV1S2 will have VLANID 100,
DEMOV2S1 and DEMOV2S2 will have VLANID 200.

del_vlan_v1s1.py will delete DEMOV1S1 and the others are similar.
